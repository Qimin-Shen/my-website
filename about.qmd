# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Qimin Shen

Welcome to my personal website! Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Master of Science in Applied Business Analytics at **Boston University**, with a background in **Economics** from **Stony Brook University**.

My interests lie at the intersection of **data analytics**, **marketing strategy**, and **technology**. I have hands-on experience with tools such as **SQL**, **Power BI**, **R**, and **AWS Cloud**, and have interned at companies like **NetEase** and **Zhi Jin Human Resources**.

Outside academics, I enjoy anime culture, running, and community events. Iâ€™ve served as a club accountant and data manager, which sharpened both my leadership and data organization skills.

I'm passionate about using data to solve real-world problems and am currently seeking opportunities in **data analytics, marketing insights, or product strategy**.
